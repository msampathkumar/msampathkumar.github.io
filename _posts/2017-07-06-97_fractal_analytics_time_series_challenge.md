## 97 - Fractal Analytics - Time Series Challenge


<a href="https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/fractal-analytics-hiring-hackathon/lb">LeaderBoard Rank 129/211</a>

#### _Goal_

Goal is to find the severals items demands using their historical demands. For some items, they share some common category, sub-categorical info. Tricky part is not all items have similar historical data, some have 9 months data and while others have only few weeks of data and we have predict 60 days into future.


#### _Issues I had_

* Lack of proper testing framework or model.
* Lack of knowledge on Time-Series Models. Example ARIMA.
* Lack of experience of time series modeling.


#### _Learning Sources_

Time Series Analysis

* [Econometrics - Ani Katchova](https://sites.google.com/site/econometricsacademy/econometrics-models/time-series-arima-models): Ani, conveys the most part of theoretical Knowledge to understand and have a quick start in Time-Series Analysis. No Code - Just Theory.
* [Econometrics Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw77aMLj9uM&list=PLz1cztQeF4YlEOn8IGY7hT39wa2Tg-XcM&index=3): A bit abstractly but conveys overall understanding of AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA, a bit deeper understanding. No Py Code - Just Theory.
* [PyData Conf - Jeffrey Yau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ-O3hk1vRw&list=PLz1cztQeF4YlEOn8IGY7hT39wa2Tg-XcM&index=4): Theory + Hands on Code. Lots of Python Notebooks also available in [Github](https://github.com/silicon-valley-data-science/pydata-sf-2016-arima-tutorial). He also shared some nice re-usable code for doing lots of analysis.
* [PyCon 2017 - Aileen Nielsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmfe2RaX-14&list=PLz1cztQeF4YlEOn8IGY7hT39wa2Tg-XcM&index=5): Complete Set. Theory + Basics + little Math + Code + Nice Notebooks in [Github](https://github.com/AileenNielsen/TimeSeriesAnalysisWithPython)

#### _Python Pkgs_

* [PyFlux](http://www.pyflux.com/philosophy/) [Documentation](http://pyflux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html): Simple tools immediately start working with Time Series Analysis.
* [Stats Models TSA](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html): Complete Package I guess. It may have everything you could ask.
* [FECON235](https://github.com/rsvp/fecon235#dt_2015-08-01_094628): I have not explored this but it seems to have lots of econometric tools.
