# Data Science Sessions

### Gist of Session1:

* Data Science is everyday things. Same as the definition of science. But what changed is the amount of data we have today.
* General pattern for any Science discoveries
	- Observations, Recording/Logging
	- Pattern Matching, Theory Formulation
	- Testing Theory, Real Life Applications.
* Stages we generally have in Data Science - 
	- 70% of work # Goal, Data Collection, Data Processing, Data Analysis - Patterns/observations, Human readable data --> Machine understandable data.
	- 20% of work # Data Modelling
	- 10 % of work # Validation.
* Types of Goal - Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised.
* ML, a subset of AI. ML focussed in self-learning Alogo’s to learn quickly from large amounts of data.
* Types of ML
   - Alog's that uses Linear Regression & Polynomial equations to understand pattern & formulate a equation
   - SVM that uses multiple Linear Regression & Polynomial equations
   - RF that are forest of graphs like tree to understand data. 
   

Long back, in the the first Data Science(2015 or 2016) session I attended in Pramati Technologies, which was given by Sachin & Apoorva, I learned this - Improve the data quality and rest improve gradually. I remember this very well because it was the time I wasted some few months* wondering how do I improve a models accuracy.

Till today I still feel good that I attending it. Just felt like sharing this. Thanks a lot Sachin.
 
### Gist of Session2:

* Recap of all above - session1.
* Sklearn - 
	- How to import sklearn - linear regression?
	- How linear regression fails if it has to describe a consine curve?
	- How polynomial curve can descrive consine curve but effects of Underfitting & Overfitting?(Razor’s Rule of selection simple model)
	- How to import & apply following models for Regression (sklearn - boston dataset)
		- Dummy Regressor, Linear Regression, SVM  Linear, RF - Regressor.
	- Validation - we used skelearn.metrics.mean_squared_error

In both the sessions, all the information that were shared is generic vocabulary in my team. No where in these sessions I went though Math or internal details - just basics as a child can understands.
