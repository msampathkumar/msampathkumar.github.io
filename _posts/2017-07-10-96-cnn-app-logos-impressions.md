### GOAL

Do logo's hold first impression on people, to try.


### Descriptions:

First impression is generally best impression for two reasons (1) It's gives first information one collects and remembers to it forever (2) For some reason it works all the time.

In today world, most everything we see/need is either a Android App or it is in Apple App Store. So, when we are looking at the Apps, for search we generally go for the Apps we have heard of its feedback from our fellow people or depending on the need.

So in the second scenario, based up on the looks we judge if an App is actually looks worth trying.

In this project, I want to build a neural network system to check if it can identify pattern that are used by most famous brands compared to not yet famous brands.

Why logo's? Because they are the first impression of a company.
