Hi, I am Sampath. I like writing but not as much as Music or my mom. Writing make me clam, I generally write my auto-biography events but that is not the purpose of this blog.

I also like Physic and Math, they are actually the definition of Science for me. Today a sensible application of these, I see in Data Science. Do you know that Data Science can not only reproduce all the Physics Laws but in fact can discover new trends and laws. It's fascinating if you ask.

	# Newtons second law
	Force = mass * acceleration

	# Newtons third law
	Action = - Reaction

	# Transportation - distance covered
	Distance(S) = (Initial Velocity(u) * time(t)) +  ((1/2) * acceleration * t * t)

	# Electricity
	Voltage = Current(I) * Resistance(R)

	# Thermodynamics
	Pressure(P) * Volume(V) = Temperature(T) * constant

	# Energy of a particle
	Energy(E) = Planks Constant(h) * Frequency(v)

	# Economics - Complex topics like
	Demand(D) - Supply(S)

These equations took several years for discover and understanding. Today these are used in various components in every uses we use(in all transportation systems, cooking, walking, eating, jumping, .. everything.

(When I was a kid I had to sit and learn all those for years :( but on the bright side for my kids, I just need to give them a simple 3 layered neural network? 

Thanks to Neural Networks, a Simple Multi-Layer Neural Net can be universal function approximator as per [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) :)


With Machine Learning(a branch of Artificial Intelligence), today we discover all these. We can answer the question before we know the questions. We can prevent diseases before they are discovered. We can predict storms, earthquake before they can.

Said that, they are just some probabilities derived by Humans. Though not Perfect, I still think a probability is still better than an unexpected failures.
