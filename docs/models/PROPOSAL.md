# Project Proposal: Gemini Model Cards

## 1. Problem Statement

Google Cloud's official documentation for Gemini models is comprehensive but
can be dense and time-consuming for developers and tech enthusiasts who need a
quick, high-level overview. There is a need for a more concise, visually
appealing, and easily shareable format to understand the key features and
capabilities of different Gemini models.

## 2. Proposed Solution

This project aims to create "Gemini Model Cards" that provide a snapshot of
each Gemini model in a clear and consistent format. These cards will be
generated as images or PDFs, making them easy to share on social media, in
presentations, or within blog posts.

The visual design will be based on the provided mock-up, ensuring a
professional and aesthetically pleasing look.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary audience for these model cards are:

- **Developers:** Who need to quickly compare models and decide which one to
  use for their application.
- **Tech Enthusiasts & Students:** Who want to learn about the latest
  advancements in Gemini models.
- **Content Creators:** Who need a quick and easy way to share information
  about Gemini models with their audience.

## 4. Key Information to Include

Each model card will include the following information, based on the provided
mock-up and industry best practices:

- **Model Details:**
  - Model Name (e.g., Gemini 2.5)
  - Model Identifier (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
  - Release Date
  - Knowledge Cut-off Date
- **Capabilities:**
  - Input/Output Modalities (e.g., Audio, Video, Text)
  - Token Limits
- **Availability:**
  - General Availability
  - Preview Availability
  - Private Availability
- **Features:**
  - Live API
  - Code Execution
  - System Instructions
  - Function Calling
  - Grounding with Google Search
- **Pricing:**
  - Input and Output pricing per million tokens/media type.
- **SDKs & ADKs:**
  - Latest versions of relevant Software and Application Development Kits.

## 5. Format

The model cards will be generated in the following formats:

- **Image (PNG):** For easy embedding in web pages and social media.
- **PDF:** For high-quality printing and sharing.

## 6. Project Structure

- **`docs/models/config`**: Stores configuration files, including the main `models.csv` data source.
- **`docs/models/reports`**: The output directory for the generated HTML reports.
- **`docs/models/downloads`**: The output directory for generated PDF and PNG files.
- **`docs/models/automation`**: Contains all the scripts and templates for the automation process.

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Finalize a template:** Refine the design of the model card based on the
   mock-up.
1. **Automate card generation:** Develop a Python script that takes model data
   from a structured source (like a CSV or JSON file) and generates the model
   cards.
1. **Gather model data:** Collect the necessary data for the different Gemini
   models.
1. **Generate and share:** Generate the cards and make them available for the
   community.
