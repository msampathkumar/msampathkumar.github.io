## Course Overview

This flagship Google AI course attracted over [420,000 registrations](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-ai-agents-intensive_2025) globally, following the success of the previous year's [Gen AI Intensive Course](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/ai-agents-intensive-recap/). The course focused on building autonomous AI agents that go beyond simple chatbots.

### 5-Day Curriculum Structure
1. **Day 1**: Introduction to Agents & Agentic Architectures
2. **Day 2**: Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP
3. **Day 3**: Context Engineering & Memory (My Leadership Area)
4. **Day 4**: Quality, Logging & Evaluation
5. **Day 5**: Prototype to Production

### Day 3 Focus: Context Engineering & Memory
As the Day 3 lead, I covered:
- **Short-term Memory**: Conversation context and session management
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learning mechanisms
- **Memory Architecture Patterns**: Best practices for production systems
- **Google ADK Integration**: Practical implementation using ADK's memory components

## Impact and Reach

- **Community Engagement**: Active participation in Discord discussions
- **Capstone Projects**: Participants used Day 3 concepts in their final projects

## Technical Stack

- **Primary Framework**: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Language**: Python
- **Tools**: Colab notebooks, Gemini API, Vector databases
- **Platforms**: Kaggle, YouTube (live sessions), Discord (community)

## Key Takeaways for Participants

Through my Day 3 curriculum, participants learned:
1. How to implement stateful AI agents using memory systems
2. Best practices for context management in production
3. Practical patterns for short-term and long-term memory
4. Integration techniques with Google ADK

This course represents Google's commitment to democratizing AI agent development, and I'm proud to have contributed to educating the next generation of AI developers.
