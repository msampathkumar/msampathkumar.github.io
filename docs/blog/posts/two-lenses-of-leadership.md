# The Two Lenses of Leadership: Operational Fixes vs. Strategic Bets

We all want to be "data-driven." It’s the mantra of modern business. But the most thrilling moment in my professional life recently wasn't finding the data; it was realizing that the same exact set of data can tell two completely different stories, depending on the lens you wear.

To explain, let’s use a hypothetical scenario.

Imagine you own a bustling downtown bakery. You analyze your sales data and find a clear, undeniable trend: 80% of your customers want your signature sourdough piping hot at exactly 8:00 AM.

This demand creates chaos. The kitchen is overwhelmed, delivery drivers are stressed, and if anything goes wrong at 7:55 AM, customer satisfaction plummets.

If you wear an **Operational Efficiency lens**, you look at that data and see a bottleneck. The logical conclusion is to smooth out the demand curve. You might think: *"Let’s offer a free cookie to anyone willing to pick up their sourdough after 10:00 AM."* You try to solve the operational stress by incentivizing customers to change their behavior. It’s smart, efficient, and cost-effective.

But if you wear a **Strategic Growth lens**, you look at that same data and see massive, untapped desire. You don't see a bottleneck; you see your biggest competitive advantage. Your conclusion isn't to shift demand; it's to meet it. You might say: *"Forget the cookies. Let's buy a second oven and hire more morning staff so we can sell twice as much sourdough at 8:00 AM."*

One lens tries to save money by optimizing the current state. The other lens tries to make money by scaling what customers love.

**The Real-World Realization**

I share this story because I recently went through my own version of the "8:00 AM sourdough rush" on a project.

We had clear data showing that a specific service protocol was overwhelmingly driving our success, but it was operationally taxing to execute. My immediate instinct—my operational lens—was to find ways to incentivize customers toward an easier alternative to relieve the pressure on our team.

Fortunately, a senior leader challenged me with the strategic lens. They argued that if this difficult protocol was the key to delighting our users, we shouldn't try to minimize it—we should figure out how to scale it aggressively.

It was a thrilling moment of perspective shift. Neither approach was "wrong." But it taught me an invaluable lesson: sometimes the goal isn’t to fix the operational pinch point by diverting demand. Sometimes, the goal is to lean into the difficulty, because that pinch point is exactly where the magic is happening.
