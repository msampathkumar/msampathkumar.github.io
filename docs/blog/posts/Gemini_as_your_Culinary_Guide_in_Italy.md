# Gemini: Your Culinary Guide in Italy 🇮🇹 🍕
Savoring Italy, One Personalized Recommendation at a Time


Last week I had a wonderful trip to Bologna, Italy. Since I don’t speak italian 🇮🇹my biggest concern was how do I ask for Indian vegetarian food ? Indian Vegetarian also known as lato-vegeterian. In short, they are vegans who also eat any milk products.

Usually my trips are planned ahead of time, but this trip was n’t. Luckily the Gemini proved invaluable. Instead of manually searching for answers to various inquiries, I leveraged its capabilities for real-time recommendations.

To Gemini, I'd provide restaurant details I am in, and it would swiftly analyze reviews to offer a curated list of top choices based on my criteria. I visited 3-4 restaurants, and by maintaining the same chat thread, Gemini developed a clear understanding of my preferences, ensuring each recommendation was highly tailored.

With Gemini assistance, I am looking forward to visiting more Italian restaurants 🇮🇹🍕😋
