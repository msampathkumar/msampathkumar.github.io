## DO's and DOnt's with Vibe Coding

Summary notes of
https://www.infoworld.com/article/4029093/9-habits-of-the-highly-ineffective-vibe-coder.html

- Do's Do experiment with different models. Different LLMs have varying
  strengths and weaknesses, and you might need to try a few to find the right
  one for your specific coding problem.

- Do treat the AI as a search tool. LLMs excel at finding and recalling
  information from their vast training data, such as obscure documentation or
  code snippets.

- Do use the AI for simple, repetitive tasks. The article suggests AI can be
  helpful for basic programming chores.

- Don'ts Don't trust the LLM completely. The article warns that LLMs can
  provide incorrect information and even "hallucinate" non-existent code or
  URLs.

- Don't treat the LLM like a "dumpster." Avoid dumping large blocks of code on
  the AI, as this can be inefficient, costly, and even confuse the model.

- Don't assume all models are the same. Each LLM has a unique internal
  structure, parameter count, and training data, which can significantly affect
  its performance.

- Don't ignore the costs. AI tools charge by the token, and repetitive requests
  or large inputs can lead to surprisingly high costs.

- Don't hand over full control. The article highlights the risk of trusting an
  LLM with critical tasks, as their inherent randomness can lead to
  unpredictable and destructive outcomes.

- Don't expect the AI to "think" like a human. LLMs are clever mimics and
  excellent at information retrieval, but they are not always good at deep
  synthesis or providing novel insights.

- Don't create inconsistent code. The randomness in LLM output can lead to a
  "patchwork quilt" of different coding styles, making the codebase messy and
  hard to maintain.
