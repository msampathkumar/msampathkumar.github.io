# Proposal: Documentation-Driven Development (D3) - A New Pattern for the AI Era


If you have worked in IT for any length of time, you know one thing for sure: user documentation is often seen as a undervalued chore. In the standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process, documentation is often an afterthought, usually started just before a product release. As an expert in software development, I can confirm that creating human-readable documentation has always been a significant challenge.

However, over the last 18 months, LLMs and Agents have shifted this perspective. Slowly but surely documentation is now starting to become a forethought. This change builds on earlier ideas about **Documentation-Driven Development (DDD)**. The core principle of DDD suggests that if an idea is thoroughly documented, then it can evolve into a product. Similarly, a feature must be drafted, to be developed, tested and then deployed; otherwise, it is considered a bug.

Given the rising prevalence of Vibe coding and AI-assisted development, documentation has arguably become a central concern. Reflecting on my own experience (a self-evaluation), I pose this question to you: **Are you, in essence, practicing Documentation-Driven Development (D3) while coding with AI?**

Let's discuss this in the comments. Is documentation still a 'boring chore' for your team, or has it become your primary development tool? I’m seeing a massive shift toward D3—are you seeing it too?
