# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a space where I share my learnings, thoughts, and experiments. You'll
find a collection of my personal notes and things I am learning.

## Gemini Cookbook

I'm excited to introduce my "Cookbook" series! This is where I'll be sharing
step-by-step guides and practical examples for various technologies.

The first cookbook in the series is the
[Google Cloud Gemini Cookbook](./google-cloud-gemini-cookbook/index.md).

## Blog

I also have a blog where I post short articles and updates. It's a place for
more informal thoughts and quick tips.

I hope you find these resources helpful!
